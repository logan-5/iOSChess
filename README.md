iOS Chess.  GUI in Objective-C.  Chess in C++.

Functional (if the slightest bit ugly) chess game conforming to all standard chess rules<sup>1</sup>, with the exception of certain draw conditions<sup>2</sup>.  You know it works because while playing it, you remember how bad you are at chess.

<sup>1</sup>Including castle, *en passant*, and pawn promotion

<sup>2</sup>Wikipedia has a fantastic list of all possible draw conditions, available here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess#Draws .  This game enforces none of them except stalemate.
